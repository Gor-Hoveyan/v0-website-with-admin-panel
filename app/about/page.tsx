              <p>
                My journey in technology began over fifteen years ago as a curious computer science student fascinated
                by the potential of artificial intelligence and data science. What started as academic interest quickly
                evolved into a passion for not just understanding these technologies, but making them accessible to
                others.
              </p>

              <p>
                After completing my advanced degrees in Computer Science and Machine Learning, I spent several years in
                industry, working with leading tech companies to develop cutting-edge AI solutions. However, I soon
                realized that my true calling was in education â€“ helping others discover and master these transformative
                technologies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of teaching at prestigious universities, developing
                curriculum for major training centers, and partnering with industry leaders to create practical,
                real-world learning experiences. My approach combines rigorous academic foundations with hands-on,
                project-based learning that prepares students for immediate impact in their careers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, I continue to innovate in education technology, developing new teaching methodologies and
                creating courses that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. My goal
                remains the same: to empower every student with the skills and confidence they need to thrive in our
                technology-driven world.
